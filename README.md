## Sudoku Solver

### Made in C

You can test the solver by using the strings found in the `*.json` files inside the directory `examples`.

- If the text at the end appears to be `white`, it was solved successfully
- If the text at the end appears to be `cyan`, it couldn't complete the whole sudoku
- If the text at the end appears to be `red`, there were some errors made while solving the sudoku

Sudoku examples in directory `examples` are from https://opensudoku.moire.org/
